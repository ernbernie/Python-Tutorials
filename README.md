Daily Short But Insightful Exercises

For best user experience, be sure to view ipynb files outside of github preview— it looks awful there and you can't run the code.

You can try these 2 options:

  • VS Code with Jupyter Extension (runs code)
  
  • Go here: https://nbviewer.org/ and add the ipynb file url like this one [github.com/ernbernie/Tutorials/blob/main/python_exercises_week1/exercise1.ipynb]
  
  Although you can't run the code on this nbviewer website, it prints out the results. 
  
Added: Week1 Exercise1 - Counting Occurrences of Each Element in an Array (Nested Loops vs Single Loop (Or Other Optimized Approaches))
