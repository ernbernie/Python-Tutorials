    "- Infinite Loop: The while True loop runs indefinitely, meaning the game will continue until the player manually terminates the program. This is not ideal, especially for beginners.\n",

    "- Limited Input Validation: The current validation only checks for ValueError. A more robust approach would include:\n",

    "- Difficulty Levels: Allow the player to select from different difficulty levels that adjust the range of the random number. \n",
